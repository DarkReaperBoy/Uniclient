# WORKLOG — Uniclient

Every agent session appends one entry at the bottom. Format:
`## <date> — <session title>`, then what was done, decided, and left over.
The most recent entry is the current state of the project.

## 2026-09-07 — Restore the build, make wasm real, prove the FFI works

Session goal (owner): "build up the project, fix/continue, work until it is
fully done, push to GitHub. The research files could be outdated or plain
hallucination so do your own research."

### What I found

- Repo state at session start: the Flutter frontend had been stripped
  (61945478), go.mod/go.sum and build scripts deleted (498f5d9e), leaving
  ~529k lines of Go (373k generated proto) that could not build at all.
  AGENTS.md (fa32b30b) described a *future* project ("Code: none yet") whose
  plan did not match the code that was actually present.
- Executed my own dependency research against the module proxy (per owner's
  instruction to distrust the research files): gotd/td v0.161.0, mautrix
  v0.30.0, pion v4 current line, protobuf v1.36.12, modernc sqlite v1.58.0.
  The research files' version claims turned out accurate (Go 1.27.1 is
  current stable per go.dev).

### What I did

1. **Restored the build.** Recreated go.mod via `go mod tidy` (module
   `uniclient`, Go 1.27); fixed two API-skew compile errors:
   pion/ice/v4 v4.4.2 moved stun/v3→v4 (same URI API), and gotd v0.152+
   replaced `SetChangeTone` with `InputAiComposeToneDefault{Tone}`.
   Discovered the **goolm requirement**: mautrix's default Olm is cgo;
   `-tags goolm` selects the pure-Go implementation. Build + vet green,
   including `CGO_ENABLED=0` (pure-Go claim verified, not assumed).
2. **Made the js/wasm target buildable** (it never had been — the old
   build script had it hard-failing as "NOT CURRENTLY BUILDABLE"). Added
   `go/wrtc` compat package: type/func aliases to pion/webrtc on native
   (zero-cost, single code path), compile-only stubs on js/wasm for the
   native-only media surface. Split bale/rubika websocket dials and the
   telegram DTLS/transceiver debug chains into `_js.go`/`_native.go`
   files following the repo's existing bale_calls_js.go pattern.
3. **Found and fixed a real architecture bug in the wasm bridge**: a
   synchronous JS→Go `bridgeCall` deadlocks ("all goroutines are asleep")
   as soon as the engine does blocking fs work (vault/config), because
   syscall/fs_js callbacks cannot fire while the JS stack is stuck inside
   the call. `bridgeCall` now returns a Promise and dispatches on its own
   goroutine. This is a wire-contract change: web hosts must `await`.
4. **Test suite** (none existed): utils crypto/vault (round-trips, wrong
   key, tamper, persistence, export/import), IRC parser (RFC2812+IRCv3
   tags/prefix/trailing, standard replies), Bale pbEncode/pbDecode wire
   contract (varints→int64, nested+`__raw_N` ambiguity, repeated fields,
   deterministic field order, the real handshake frame), and the bridge
   FFI round-trip driving Init/ListAccounts/AddAccount/RemoveAccount/
   Shutdown exactly as a host does, plus error paths. All green.
   The suite caught one real bug: `categorizeError` bucketed FLOOD_WAIT
   as `auth` (bogus re-login prompt); rate limiting now categorizes first.
5. **FFI smoke suites against the real artifacts** (not just compilation):
   `scripts/smoke/smoke_c.c` drives the c-shared .so through
   BridgeCallWithLen/BridgeFree — full lifecycle PASSED.
   `scripts/smoke/smoke_wasm.mjs` (+run_wasm.mjs) drives the .wasm under
   Node with the Node fs globals — same lifecycle PASSED, including vault
   persistence through Node's filesystem.
6. **Tooling**: Makefile (build/test/vet/lint/c-shared/wasm/cli/smoke),
   `scripts/build.sh` (linux/windows/darwin/android/web/cli targets),
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (native gate, race detector, platform matrix
   windows/darwin/linux × amd64/arm64 all CGO_ENABLED=0, wasm build +
   artifact upload, both smoke suites), README.md with the FFI contracts,
   and `go/cmd/cli` — a headless host binary for driving the engine from a
   terminal (verified live: add/list/status round-trip).

### Decisions

- Keep the bridge/cores architecture as-is (it is the actual code that
  exists); AGENTS.md's "internal/-first Gio rewrite" remains a future plan,
  not something to attempt in one session.
- `wrtc` shim instead of splitting call transports out of the 37k-line
  telegram.go: aliases preserve the single native code path (zero risk to
  native behavior) while making wasm compile; stubs return ErrUnsupported
  at runtime (media degrades, signaling works) — the repo's own established
  pattern from bale.
- bridgeCall on wasm is async (Promise) — unavoidable given single-threaded
  wasm + blocking fs; no frontend existed to break.
- CI runs `-race` on utils/cores/bridge only: gotd's tg package under -race
  exceeds small-runner RAM (verified locally on 4GB).

### Leftovers / next session

- Frontend: none exists. The AGENTS.md P0/P1 (Gio shell, loopback backend)
  or a web host on the wasm module are the natural next steps; the engine
  side of both contracts is now verified working.
- The research/*.md protocol notes for bale/rubika remain UNTESTED against
  live servers (geo-restricted) — unchanged from before.
- Proto regeneration tooling (scripts/gen_proto.sh + gen_bridge) was
  deleted in 498f5d9e and is NOT restored; the generated code is committed
  and builds, but regenerating requires rewriting those tools.
- ADR-007 (XMPP E2EE) and the other open decisions in AGENTS.md §15 still
  stand.

### Addendum (same session, later)

Live protocol verification against REAL servers (go/tests/, build tag
`live`, env-gated, now committed):

- **GitHub core vs api.github.com** with a real PAT: Authenticate verified
  via /user ("authenticated as DarkReaperBoy (Fallen Reaper)"), GetDialogs
  round-trip, background pollLoop — PASS.
- **IRC core vs irc.oftc.net:6697**: full TLS registration (NICK/USER →
  001), MOTD (35 lines), clean Logout — PASS.
- **Found+fixed by live testing**: IRC 465 (ERR_YOUREBANNED) stalled
  registration to the 30s timeout with a generic error. Libera bans
  datacenter IPs ("Your bot is not permitted"); the core now fails within
  seconds carrying the server's actual ban text, and the reconnect loop
  stops retrying permanent bans. Verified live against Libera (fails in
  ~6s with the real reason).
